  <h1>What is Green Space and Why Does It Matter?</h1>
  <h2>Why Green Space Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Green space refers to areas filled with plants, trees, and grass that people can access, such as parks, gardens, and tree-lined streets.
    These spaces are important not only for the environment but also for people's mental and physical health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Green spaces improve the environment by cleaning the air and water, reducing heat in cities, and supporting wildlife.
    They provide a safe place for animals to live and move through urban areas. Without these spaces, cities can become polluted.
    Green spaces also have a positive effect on mental health by reducing stress, improving memory, and helping people feel happier.
    Spending time in nature helps people feel better and think more clearly.
  </p>

  <h2>What Can We Do to Increase Green Space?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>-Create more green spaces, especially in cities where they are often lacking.</li>
    <li>-Build more parks and plant trees in urban neighborhoods.</li>
    <li>-Add green roofs and vertical gardens to buildings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By making nature more accessible, we can help improve the environment and people's well-being.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Works</h2>
  <p>
    The benefits of green spaces are clear. Spending time outside lowers stress, helps people focus better, and boosts happiness.
    For children, green spaces support learning, improve impulse control, and reduce issues like obesity and depression.
    Nature has proven benefits that improve both physical and mental health.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Green spaces are crucial for both the environment and people’s health. They help clean the air and water, provide shelter for animals,
    and improve mental and physical well-being. We should focus on creating more of these spaces so everyone can benefit from nature.
