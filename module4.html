    <h1>Environmental Injustice: Who Was at Risk?</h1>
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    The Atlantic Coast Pipeline would have run through small towns where people didn't have a say about what happened to their land.
    It would have hurt the air, the earth, and the health of the people living there. One such town was Union Hill, which was an
    historic community built by freed African Americans. This is significant because all people deserve clean air and a healthy home,
    no matter where they live or who they are.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Can Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>-Make sure that people bring communities into planning for huge projects like pipelines.</li>
    <li>-Use cleaner power, like sun and wind, instead of gas that pollutes the world.</li>
    <li>-Protect where humans live by creating laws that stop unfair treatment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Works</h2>
  <p>
    These ideas work because Union Hill proved that your voice counts. When people make themselves heard and unite,
    big businesses and even judges have to listen. Creating clean energy also keeps the planet for future generations.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The Atlantic Coast Pipeline was stopped due to the fact that people resisted. It shows that no matter what size town you are in,
    you can cause change. We all have rights to breathe clean air, live in a safe environment, and have input on what happens in our
    community. When we stand up for ourselves, we can safeguard the planet and each other.
